This is a work in progress. I got the idea from a "smart" clock I saw. It was quite nice.
Looked like a brick with large colorful pixels. Can't find it anymore though. Anyway
it could show the weather, mail etc. I liked it, but it was expensive (>â‚¬100) and closed
to their app for control.

A bit later i saw [this nice IKEA hack](https://hackaday.com/2019/06/12/ikea-cloud-lamp-displays-the-weather-with-esp8266/).
Its a IKEA cloud lamp that changes color depending on the weather and even flashes for
lightning storms! Very nice.

## The plan
The plan is to build a smart clock for my sons room, it would be super cool if it could
be the hub for some kind of voice control, but first off I want it to tell what the
weather will be for the upcoming day. I asked my son, and he'd rather have an analog
clock instead of a digital, so I bought a cheap ordinary wall clock. It had no numbering,
I guess to look clean, so that is something I will need to fix in the future.

I wanted to line the clock with RGB leds so I could mark out the weather approximately
where the hour mark is. This means the clock can tell the weather for the upcoming 12
hours.

I'm planning to use a Raspberry Pi Zero W for the brains of it.

## The build so far

![clock in my workspace](/img/clock/sm-workspace.jpg)

Any sane person would here go and buy a nice Adafruit led
strip and just line the edge of the clock with it. But I
like to use what I already have in my stash, and one of the
things I have are several
[Flora Neopixels](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1260)
(I bought two 20 packs that where on a ridiculous sale).

I decided to use 8 of them, to make it a bit easier to solder
and to not overwhelm the Raspberry Pi Zero.

The neopixel needs 3 wires, power and a signal, and that
sinal needs to be chained to the next pixel. That means
three wires between each of them.

Looking around my workspace for some wire I happened to see
some copper tape that I bought to experiment with. The tape
is supposed to be used in the garden to create a barrier
for slugs. It has a copper foil over a paper/plastic back.
So you can't tape a circuit together, but you *can* solder
to it!

The middle lane of tape is the signal, and since it needs
to chain the neopixels together I took a flat screwdriver
and just scraped away a spot where the neopixel should be.

Works like a charm! I also soldered three wires to it. The plan
is to drill a hole through the backplate and place the raspberry
pi zero on the back.

So now it's time for the software... and that's where it's
hanging in limbo right now.

Future plans involve speakers or buzzer for alarm, camera for
keeping track of intruders (or waving to turn of alarm!)
