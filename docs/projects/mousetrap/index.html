      <h1>The mouse trap</h1>

<p><img src="/img/mousetrap/sm-rigged.jpeg" alt="rigged trap"></p>
<p>We had a a problem. It was small furry and super cute. And it pooped
everywhere. The mouse had already foiled a couple of traditional traps
we set for it so I knew I had to take matters into my own hands.</p>
<p>This is actually not an unfinished project. Its not nice looking,
well built or good code. <strong>But it caught the mouse!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PVC pipe</li>
<li>Two metal plates</li>
<li>Arduino</li>
<li>Small servo (small enough to be driven directly by the arduino)</li>
<li>Small metal pin, the kind use to fasten knitting needles</li>
<li>Duct tape</li>
<li>Popsicle sticks</li>
<li>Copper tape (I used the one used for keeping slugs out of your garden)</li>
<li>Some wooden planks</li>
<li>Some screws</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="build">Build <a class="direct-link" href="#build" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The build is quite simple. A trigger at the end of a PVC pipe triggers a
closing mechanism on the other side. The trick is that the pipe is so long
the mouse doesn't have a chance to bolt.</p>
<p><img src="/img/mousetrap/sm-pressure_plate.jpg" alt="trigger with peanut butter"></p>
<p>The &quot;pressure plate&quot; is to popsicle sticks with copper tape on them.
A bit of a broken popsicle stick in the middle keeps them from touching
until the weight of the mouse is on it. Btw peanut butter is great for
mouse traps.</p>
<p>The arduino code just polls with a <code>digitalRead</code> and sweeps the servo
at the first hint of any critters.</p>

<p>The closing mechanism is super simple, the metal plate is a bit heavy and
when the servo removes the pin it falls down. Sawing a bit down into the
wood makes sure the mouse can't push get a hold and push it up.</p>
